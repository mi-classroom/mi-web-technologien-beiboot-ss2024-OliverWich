# Frontend - Vue 3

## Status

TBD

## Context


* [Magickwand.js](https://github.com/mmomtchev/magickwand.js)
* [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)


## Decision

This decision was rather easy since I have most experience with Vue, it was chosen.

This also implies the usage of [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as this is the default bundler Vue 3 uses.

Due to trying out something new on the backend, I decided to play it safe for the frontend.

## Consequences

Pros:
* Lots of personal experience
* Nice component system
* Easy reactivity
* Tons of community made libraries and plugins

Cons:
* A lot of learning material around Elysia and so on is written in react
* None (arguably the best framework, come at me react fans)
  * As framework choice is mostly personal preference
