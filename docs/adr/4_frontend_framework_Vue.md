# Frontend - Vue 3

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Every web application needs a frontend and frontend development is way easier when using a framework.

A few popular choices for JavaScript based applications are:
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)


## Decision

This decision was rather easy since I have most experience with Vue, it was chosen.

This also implies the usage of [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as this is the default bundler Vue 3 uses.

Due to trying out something new on the backend, I decided to play it safe for the frontend.

## Consequences

Pros:
* Lots of personal experience
* Nice component system
* Easy reactivity
* Tons of community made libraries and plugins

Cons:
* A lot of learning material around Elysia and so on is written in react
* None (arguably the best framework, come at me react fans)
  * As framework choice is mostly personal preference
